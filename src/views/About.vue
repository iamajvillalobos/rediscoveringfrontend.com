        <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm AJ. I'm a web developer from Manila, Philippines.</p>
        <p class="pt-3">
          I love how exciting ðŸ¤© front-end web development these days.
          Before that I was a Ruby developer and working both frontend and
          backend but not doing great at both.

        <p class="pt-3">
          This year
          <span class="text-grey-darker text-base">(2019)</span> as I
          transition to working more in the frontend, I want to share my
          experiences and learnings here in this blog.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-3">
          Hope you enjoy reading here and will have something
          new learned.
